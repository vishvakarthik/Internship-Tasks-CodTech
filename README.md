DESCRIPTION: #CodTech Internship Tasks: Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my internship submission repository for **CodTech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**, showcasing four practical tasks focused on key machine learning and data science concepts. This repository contains well-structured, Jupyter Notebook-based implementations of Decision Trees, Sentiment Analysis, Image Classification using CNNs, and a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering techniques. Each task demonstrates the end-to-end workflow, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and result visualization.

##**Task 1: Decision Tree Classifier**

In Task 1, I built and visualized a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `scikit-learn` on a sample dataset. Decision Trees are intuitive supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. The notebook includes:
- Loading and splitting the dataset.
- Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Visualizing the decision tree using `plot_tree` for interpretability.
- Evaluating the model’s accuracy on test data.
This task highlights how Decision Trees make decisions based on feature splits, providing a clear understanding of the decision-making process.

##**Task 2: Sentiment Analysis**

Task 2 focuses on performing **Sentiment Analysis** on a dataset of customer reviews using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and a **Logistic Regression** model. Sentiment Analysis is widely used in NLP to determine the sentiment polarity (positive or negative) of text data. The notebook includes:
- Text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction.
- Building and training the Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Displaying example predictions for a quick qualitative check.
This task demonstrates how to convert raw text into numerical features and apply machine learning for text classification.

##**Task 3: Image Classification using CNN**

In Task 3, I built an **Image Classification model** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with TensorFlow/Keras on the popular MNIST dataset. CNNs are powerful deep learning architectures for computer vision tasks. This notebook showcases:
- Loading and normalizing image data.
- Building a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- Training and validating the model.
- Visualizing training/validation accuracy and loss over epochs.
- Making predictions on sample test images.
The model achieves good accuracy, demonstrating how CNNs learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.

##**Task 4: Recommendation System**

Task 4 presents a simple **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering** techniques with cosine similarity. Recommender systems are crucial in modern applications like e-commerce and streaming services. The notebook includes:
- A user-item rating matrix example.
- Calculating user-user similarity using cosine similarity.
- Generating predicted ratings for missing values.
- Displaying top recommended items for a sample user.
- An evaluation metric (e.g., RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
This task highlights how similar users’ preferences can be leveraged to make personalized recommendations.

##✅**Technologies Used**

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` for traditional ML models and similarity measures
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `TensorFlow`/`Keras` for deep learning (CNN)
- `Surprise` library (optional) for matrix factorization

##**Key Learning Outcomes**

Through these tasks, I gained practical experience in:
- Handling structured and unstructured datasets.
- Implementing supervised ML models for classification problems.
- Applying NLP techniques for text classification.
- Designing and training deep learning models for image data.
- Building a simple recommendation system from scratch.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualizing results to interpret model behavior.
